The term **'business'** is somewhat ambiguous. It is an action of yielding money and doing something that **you** manage, when it is used in daily terms. However, for people who are doing there own business or are very into the business field, all of them have their own definition of business.

For me, business is made up of 3-axis.

First, **my interest**, or the interest of things that are related to me or my business. Me, cofounders, employees, shareholders ecetra. Especially in capitalism, the interest would mean money.

Second, **interest of the world in the scope of mine**. This is not the survival condition of a business, but it is important factor for me. It is about, "Do I truly think this contributes to the better world?".

Third, the most important, **what people want**. I guess this is the fundamental condition for businesses to survive. But if this is the only goal for your business, you'd better go to make an opioids for public.

Satisfying all three axis is the way I describe what business is. And this can be extended to our daily lives, in every situation. Satisfying the related entities while making the world better.
