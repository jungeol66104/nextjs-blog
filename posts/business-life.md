The term **'business'** can be ambiguous. In everyday context, it often refers to activities that yield money and are managed by an individual or entity. However, for those who own or are deeply involved in businesses, **the definition can be quite personal**.

&nbsp;

To me, business revolves around **three core principles**:

&nbsp;

First, it's about my **personal interests** and the interests of those connected to my business â€“ such as co-founders, employees, and shareholders. In a capitalist system, these interests often equate to financial gain.

&nbsp;

Second, it's the **global interest within my purview**. While this may not be a survival necessity for a business, it's significant to me. Essentially, I ask, "Do I genuinely believe this contributes to a better world?"

&nbsp;

Third and most crucially, it's **what people desire**. I believe this is the foundational requirement for businesses to thrive. However, if this is the sole focus of your business, you might as well be producing opioids for the masses.

&nbsp;

Balancing these three principles defines my concept of business. This perspective can also apply to everyday situations, **ensuring that while catering to associated stakeholders, we also strive for a better world**.
